# CO520-Assessment4-In-Class-Test


This was my final assessment for my further object orientated modules (CO520). It was an in class test which was one and a half hours long in which we were given a previously unseen specification and had to write code to meet this specification to the best of our abilities.

I recieved 98% for this assessment.
